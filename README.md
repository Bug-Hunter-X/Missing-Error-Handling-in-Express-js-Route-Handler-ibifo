# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling in route handlers. The `bug.js` file contains code that fetches user data from a database. However, it lacks proper error handling for cases where the database operation fails. This can lead to cryptic 500 error responses, making debugging difficult.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling. It checks for database errors and sends more informative error responses to the client.  This improved error handling provides better user experience and facilitates easier debugging.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1.  Run `bug.js`.
2.  Make a request to `/users/:id` where `:id` is an invalid user ID or causes a database error.
3. Observe the generic 500 error response.

## How the Solution Works

The solution handles potential errors from the database operation and provides more informative error responses based on the type of error.  This prevents unexpected 500 errors and gives clients and developers better context for diagnosing issues.
